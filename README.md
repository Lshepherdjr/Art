I choose to do a vector image for this project it is an image of my the sun setting over the ocean. I choose this because I enjoy paintings, so I made the image look like a painting. I started the project by using a photo I found on adobe illustrator, Once I found the photo, I had to drag the picture to create a new file then used create option to start the project. While using illustrator I used image trace to turn image into a vector image. My settings were the preset: 6 colors, view: tracing results, mode: color, threshold: 151 less black. Advance settings, path: 91%, comers: 60, noise about 50%, method: abutting, create: fills, and options snap to curved lines.  I had to expand the image to start filling in with color. The color used to fill my image were blue, cyan, pink, orange, purple and a mix of orange and yellow. The outcome of my assignment is to be a photo changed to a sunset painting in vector.
