Adobe Illustrator Creating Vector Images

By Larry Shepherd

This tutorial is how to create a vetor image out of a photo by using Adobe.
Target audience for this tuorial is for any age that is interested in creating vector images.


This vector image is the sun setting over the ocean. I choose this because I enjoy paintings, so I made the image look like a painting. I started the project by using a photo I found on adobe illustrator, Once I found the photo, I had to drag the picture to create a new file then used create option to start the project. While using illustrator I used image trace to turn image into a vector image.

My settings were presets: 6 colors, view: tracing results, mode: color, threshold: 151 less black. Advance settings, path: 91%, comers: 60, noise about 50%, method: abutting, create: fills, and options snap to curved lines.  I had to expand the image to start filling in with color. The color used to fill my image were blue, cyan, pink, orange, purple and a mix of orange and yellow. I hope the lesson on how to create a vector image was Informative.
